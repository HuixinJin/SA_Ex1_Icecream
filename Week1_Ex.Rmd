## Week1 Excercise


####First we generate samples containing 100 values for log-normal distribution (meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```{r cars}
a = rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
a
```

####Then we show some characters of our sample.
```{r}
summary(a)
sd(a)
```
Its mean is 2.776 and standard variance is 0.6677292.  

####Finally we plot its distribution and log scale distribution.
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
par(mfcol = c(1,2))
hist(a,breaks = seq(1,6,0.2))
hist(log(a),breaks = seq(0,2,0.2))
```
